# Academic Paper Review

## Overview

This skill produces a structured, peer-review-style analysis of a single academic paper.

It is designed for depth on one paper, not breadth across many papers.

Source note:
- Imported for ResearchLab from Deer Flow public skills
- Upstream repository: `https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow`
- Installed as a project-local compatibility copy for `ResearchLab`

## When To Use

Use this skill when:

- the user provides one paper URL or PDF
- the user asks to review or critique one paper
- the user wants a structured academic analysis
- the user wants strengths, weaknesses, novelty, rigor, and improvement suggestions

Do not use it for multi-paper literature surveys; use `systematic-literature-review` for those.

## Review Workflow

### Phase 1: Paper Comprehension

Read the paper carefully before judging it.

Extract:

- title
- authors
- venue or status
- year
- domain
- paper type

Then understand:

1. abstract and introduction
2. related work
3. methodology
4. experiments and results
5. limitations and discussion
6. conclusion and whether it matches the evidence

### Phase 2: Key Claims

List the major claims and the evidence supporting them.

For each claim, assess whether support is:

- strong
- moderate
- weak

### Phase 3: Critical Analysis

Assess:

- soundness
- novelty
- reproducibility
- experimental design
- statistical rigor
- scalability or practicality

If appropriate, do targeted literature lookup to position the paper relative to nearby work.

### Phase 4: Structured Review

The final review should usually include:

1. Paper metadata
2. Executive summary
3. Summary of contributions
4. Strengths
5. Weaknesses
6. Methodology assessment
7. Questions for the authors
8. Minor issues
9. Literature positioning
10. Recommendations

## Review Principles

- Be specific and evidence-based
- Distinguish fatal flaws from fixable issues
- Give credit where it is due
- Suggest how weaknesses could be addressed
- Evaluate the submitted work, not the paper you wish existed

## Important Note

If the user asks for a broader topic survey rather than a one-paper critique, switch to `systematic-literature-review` instead of forcing a single-paper template.
