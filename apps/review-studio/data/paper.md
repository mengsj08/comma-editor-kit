# Scalable Provenance-Aware Orchestration for Multi-Agent Scientific Computing

**Authors:** J. River, Q. Jun, A. Fable, and the Orchestration Working Group

**Preprint (simulated, not peer reviewed) — generated for the SKL-20 editor spike.**

> Abstract. We present a provenance-aware orchestration layer that coordinates heterogeneous language-model agents over scientific computing workloads. Our core contribution is an anchor mechanism that binds reviewer comments to document spans using prefix/suffix context rather than line numbers, so that annotations remain stable under upstream insertion and deletion. We formalize the cost cascade $C = \sum_{i} p_i \cdot u_i$ and show empirically that human decision load drops while escape counts stay bounded.

**Keywords:** provenance, orchestration, multi-agent systems, reproducibility, comment anchoring, cost cascade.

## 1. Introduction

We now examine introduction in the context of reproducible multi-agent pipelines.

The central difficulty with introduction is that provenance must survive edits without breaking anchors.

Prior systems treat introduction as a static field, but our decision-stream model treats it as an append-only event ledger.

Concretely, each introduction observation is recorded with an actor, a timestamp, and a falsifiable summary.

This lets a reviewer reconstruct why a given state was asserted about introduction rather than trusting a rendered dashboard.

where the per-step cost decomposes as $C = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i u_i$ and the undo penalty $\rho(a) = P(\text{wrong}) \times \text{cost-to-undo}(a)$ gates delegation whenever $\rho(a) > \kappa$.

This lets a reviewer reconstruct why a given state was asserted about conclusion / complexity rather than trusting a rendered dashboard.

We now examine conclusion / complexity in the context of reproducible multi-agent pipelines.

The central difficulty with conclusion / complexity is that provenance must survive edits without breaking anchors.

Prior systems treat conclusion / complexity as a static field, but our decision-stream model treats it as an append-only event ledger.

Concretely, each conclusion / complexity observation is recorded with an actor, a timestamp, and a falsifiable summary.

As shown in Equation for section 15, the inline bound $O(n \log n)$ holds because each anchor touches $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ blocks. The normalized residual is $\hat{r} = \frac{\lVert x - \bar x \rVert_2}{\sigma}$.
